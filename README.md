# Enhanced Risk Stratification for Stage II Colorectal Cancer Using Deep Learning-based CT Classifier and Pathological Markers to Optimize Adjuvant Therapy Decision

IRIS-CRC is a free, open-source risk stratification system designed to optimize adjuvant therapy decision-making for stage II colorectal cancer patients by integrating CT imaging features with established pathological markers.
Developed at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital by a research team led by Zaiyi Liu, who envisioned a tool that would enhance clinical decision-making by providing more precise risk stratification than conventional methods. Current IRIS-CRC development is led by Yanqi Huang, Xiaobo Chen and colleagues across multiple medical centers in China.
IRIS-CRC provides AI-driven risk assessment using deep learning algorithms, as well as integration with pathological factors and intuitive result interpretation. In addition to these core functions, IRIS-CRC offers many supporting utilities. Some of the core capabilities of IRIS-CRC include:

 - Multi-planar CT image analysis for comprehensive tumor assessment
 - Integration of established pathological risk factors (pT stage, NLNS, LVI, PNI)
 - Four-tier risk stratification with clear prognostic implications
 - User-friendly interface designed for clinical implementation
 - Support for DICOM format CT images
 - Robust validation across multiple centers with large patient dataset
